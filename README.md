# horiseon-code-refactor
Description

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. was in need of consolidating and refactoring the code for their website. This exercise called for taking the orginal and unorganzied HTML/CSS and transforming them into concise, detailed and easy to read documents. 

The process I took to rework this assignment was to start with the HTML and then move to the CSS. Since HTML is the foundation of this website, I thought it was important to rename all of the div tags to more detailed semantic tags. Next, I added alt tags to each of the photos on the webpage. Lastly, I added comments in each section to quickly describe to anyone examining the HTML what each section is accomplishing. Once the HTML was updated I moved to reorganzing the CSS document. There were multiple class tags that did not need to be changed, but consolidated. It is also important to rearrange the CSS to have all of the selector tags on top and the class tags following. 

It is important to simplify the layout of these documents in case you have the chance to work with a larger team on this website. The easy accessability of these documents is crucial for making sure everyone is aware of what is going on in the project. Now that the website is reorganized, the company is able to move forward with multiple developers to help with future projects. 

Potential future projects for this website would be to add locations for each of the nav bar buttons.
